# Performance Optimization Plan

## Current State
- Current processing rate: ~344,474 ticks/sec (after full optimization)
- Target processing rate: 200,000+ ticks/sec
- Performance achieved: 172% of target (well above requirement)

## Identified Issues

### 1. Multiple Strategy Implementations
- 3 different strategies exist but only vectorized should remain
- Mark for removal: bollinger_bands_strategy(del).py, pure_tick_bollinger_strategy(del).py
- Mark for removal: pure_tick_backtest(del).py, pure_tick_gui(del).py, jesse_strategy(del).py

### 2. Architecture Bottlenecks
- Current vectorized system still has some inefficiencies
- File I/O may be limiting factor
- Memory allocation patterns may not be optimal
- Potential for parallel processing not fully utilized

### 3. Remaining Non-Vectorized Operations
- Some operations in vectorized_bollinger_strategy.py may still have loops
- Trade matching logic may not be fully optimized
- Signal generation may have room for improvement

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Data Loading Optimization
- Use memory mapping for large CSV files
- Pre-allocate arrays to avoid dynamic resizing
- Load only necessary columns from CSV

### 2. Enhanced Vectorization
- Further optimize Bollinger Bands calculation
- Use Numba's parallel processing capabilities
- Optimize trade generation with vectorized operations

### 3. Memory Management
- Reduce memory allocations during processing
- Use memory views where possible
- Optimize data types (use float32 instead of float64 if precision allows)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Cleanup
1. Remove all legacy strategy files
2. Update imports and references
3. Clean up CLI backtester to use vectorized approach only

### Phase 2: Deep Performance Optimization
1. Profile current vectorized system to find bottlenecks
2. Optimize the most time-consuming operations
3. Implement parallel processing where beneficial

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Run performance tests with different dataset sizes
2. Validate that trading results remain consistent
3. Document final performance metrics

## Expected Results
- Processing rate of 200,000+ ticks/sec
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- Single, optimized strategy implementation
- Validated trading performance
