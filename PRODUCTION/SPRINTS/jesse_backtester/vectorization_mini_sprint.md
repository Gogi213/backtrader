# Full Vectorization Sprint for Pure Tick HFT System

## Objective
Complete overhaul of the Pure Tick HFT system to achieve maximum performance for processing 4+ million ticks using full vectorization techniques.

## Current Architecture Problems
1. **Primary Issue**: `for i, row in tick_df.iterrows()` loop in `pure_tick_backtest.py` processes each tick individually
2. **Secondary Issue**: Strategy designed for single-tick processing, not array processing
3. **Tertiary Issue**: CSV format for large datasets
4. **Quaternary Issue**: Redundant calculations with repeated BB computations

## Full Vectorization Strategy

### 1. Core Architecture Changes

#### A. Vectorized Backtesting Engine
Replace the current loop-based approach with a fully vectorized one:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import sliding_window_view
from numba import njit, prange
import pandas as pd

@njit(parallel=True)
def vectorized_bb_calculation(prices, period, std_dev):
    """Calculate BB for entire price array at once"""
    n = len(prices)
    sma = np.full(n, np.nan)
    std = np.full(n, np.nan)
    
    # Use parallel processing for rolling calculations
    for i in prange(period-1, n):
        sma[i] = np.mean(prices[i-period+1:i+1])
        std[i] = np.std(prices[i-period+1:i+1])
    
    upper_band = sma + (std * std_dev)
    lower_band = sma - (std * std_dev)
    
    return sma, upper_band, lower_band

@njit(parallel=True)
def vectorized_signal_generation(prices, sma, upper_band, lower_band, stop_loss_pct):
    """Generate all signals for the entire dataset at once"""
    n = len(prices)
    entry_signals = np.full(n, 0)  # 0: no signal, 1: long, -1: short
    exit_signals = np.full(n, 0)   # 0: no signal, 1: exit long, -1: exit short
    position_status = np.full(n, 0)  # 0: no position, 1: long, -1: short
    
    for i in prange(1, n):
        # Entry signals based on price touching bands
        if prices[i] <= lower_band[i] and prices[i-1] > lower_band[i-1]:
            if position_status[i-1] == 0:  # No current position
                entry_signals[i] = 1  # Long signal
                position_status[i] = 1
        elif prices[i] >= upper_band[i] and prices[i-1] < upper_band[i-1]:
            if position_status[i-1] == 0:  # No current position
                entry_signals[i] = -1  # Short signal
                position_status[i] = -1
                
        # Exit signals based on stop loss or mean reversion
        if position_status[i-1] == 1:  # Long position
            stop_loss = prices[i-1] * (1 - stop_loss_pct)
            if prices[i] <= stop_loss or prices[i] >= sma[i]:
                exit_signals[i] = 1 # Exit long
                position_status[i] = 0
        elif position_status[i-1] == -1:  # Short position
            stop_loss = prices[i-1] * (1 + stop_loss_pct)
            if prices[i] >= stop_loss or prices[i] <= sma[i]:
                exit_signals[i] = -1  # Exit short
                position_status[i] = 0
        else:
            position_status[i] = position_status[i-1]
    
    return entry_signals, exit_signals, position_status
```

#### B. Optimized Data Processing Pipeline
```python
def load_and_process_data_vectorized(csv_path, bb_period=50, bb_std=2.0, stop_loss_pct=0.005):
    """Load data and perform all calculations in vectorized manner"""
    # Load data efficiently
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
    
    # Extract numpy arrays for vectorized operations
    prices = df['price'].values.astype(np.float64)
    times = df['time'].values
    qtys = df['qty'].values
    
    # Calculate all BB values at once
    sma, upper_band, lower_band = vectorized_bb_calculation(prices, bb_period, bb_std)
    
    # Generate all signals at once
    entry_signals, exit_signals, position_status = vectorized_signal_generation(
        prices, sma, upper_band, lower_band, stop_loss_pct
    )
    
    # Create results dataframe
    results_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'time': times,
        'price': prices,
        'qty': qtys,
        'sma': sma,
        'upper_band': upper_band,
        'lower_band': lower_band,
        'entry_signal': entry_signals,
        'exit_signal': exit_signals,
        'position_status': position_status
    })
    
    return results_df
```
